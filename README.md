# UPnP Port Forwarder
A simple UPnP port forward tool


## Description

UPnP port forwarder is a tool that utilizes [Mono.Nat](https://github.com/mono/Mono.Nat) to forward ports. You can add as many ports
as you want to the forwarder, select the protocol (TCP, UDP or both) and then proceed to forward your ports. Successfully forwarded ports will be marked with green color and failed ports will be marked with red. 

There is also a port checker tool that checks if the port has been opened successfully, given  that a service runs on the background and listens to it.


Enjoy.
